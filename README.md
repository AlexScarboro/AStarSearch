# AStarSearch
The A* (referred to as A Star or AStar) Search algorithm is a common pathfinding algorithm.  In a fully-observable environment where there are both pathable and blocked nodes, the agent must find a good path from their starting node to the goal node. The agent must use the A* algorithm to determine its path. For this program, the heuristic value is calculated using the Manhattan method (the cost of moving from one node to another without traversing diagonals is a constant amount per node). The console output displays the 15x15 grid with 0's indicating pathable areas, 1's indicating blocked areas, a "2" for the starting node, and a "3" for the goal node.
